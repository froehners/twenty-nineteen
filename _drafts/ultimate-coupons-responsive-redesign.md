Ultimate Coupons offers coupons and deals for a variety of stores. The target audience is women in their 30s. Ultimate Coupons also has a blog with a variety of content types.

The [merchant pages](http://www.ultimatecoupons.com/coupons/container_store_coupons.htm) primarily serve to feature curated coupons and discounts, but Ultimate Coupons also has Savings Tips, a Most Popular Days widget, and similar stores. A/B tests are being used to determine which layout yields the highest click-through rates, highest engagement, and lowest bounce rate.

The [homepage](http://www.ultimatecoupons.com/) redesign needed to have a carousel, two blog posts, two listicles, several coupons, and featured merchants. It also needed to be responsive and designed from the desktop down.

The new [WordPress blog](http://www.ultimatecoupons.com/blog/) template needed to be “foolproof” for the various freelance bloggers that may not be WordPress-savvy (and probably don’t know how to edit photos without stretching them).

My design goals stressed legibility (such as conforming to the WCAG contrast guidelines) and trustworthiness. I wanted the site and blog to look clean and use subtle animations without impacting the functionality or the browsing experience.
