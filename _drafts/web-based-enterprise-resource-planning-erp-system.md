# Background

[Unity](http://www.fivesixtwo.com/unity) is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System used by Traffic Management, Inc. (TMI). It is a central data hub for their entire business and connects to a companion iPad app for field employees.

## Problem

TMI was using a Microsoft Access application to manage all their resources. It was slow and clunky after being developed over the life of the company; it could no longer scale with the growing business.

## Goals

* **Better user experience.** Implement a feedback loop and reduce frustration. How can we make their workdays a little easier?
* **Reduce errors.** Everyone used the previous solution a little differently.
* **Standardization.** Reduce "hacks" and employee workarounds. Eliminate tech debt and use consistent data conventions.
* **Scale.** Be expandable and adaptable to evolving business needs

## Requirements

* One system to handle all day to day operations
* Convenient mobile access - eliminate the need for Remote Desktop
* Clean, reliable data

## Audience

Unity is used across the company. Access, capabilities, modules and views were based on roles.

* Estimating and sales
* Project management
* Dispatch, vehicle and equipment management
* Contact management
* Human Resources (policies, payroll)
* Billing

# Design Process

Because Unity is a system, we established a repeatable process.

### Research & Discovery

* **Stakeholder Interviews & Workshops:** establish the purpose and business requirements
* **User Interviews & Observation:** Get into the field and observe and document how people are solving the problem/using the old system now. We need to understand the people using the module.
* **Heuristic/Usability Review:** If we are redesigning an existing module, where can we apply best practices
* **Competitive/Comparative Analysis:** How have other people solved these problems? What can we learn from industry standards? Where will we innovate?

### Plan & Strategize

* **Brainstorm Solutions:** Whiteboards, workshops, and sketching constraint-free ideas.
* **User Flows & Task Analysis:** map out the userâ€™s flow to complete the tasks and how it fits into the larger system. Where else will this data be used?

### Ongoing Work: Feedback & Monitoring 

# Results

We designed for accessibility and listened to user needs to improve the experience. We also implemented design standards and best practices.

### Highlights

* Reduced design and development time by using repeatable patterns.
* Implemented a performance budget. Unity is more lightweight and much faster to use than their previous solution. A budget allows us to balance design and engineering decisions. 
* Every module can adapt to a wide range of content sizes, meaning TMI is not constrained by project or client size.
* Improved visibility. Project managers can "watch" anything within Unity. They receive emails that notify them of any activity or change in status.
