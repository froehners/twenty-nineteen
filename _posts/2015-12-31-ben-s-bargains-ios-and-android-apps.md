excerpt: Ben's Bargains did not have a consistent brand experience across all devices.
  They had an mDot version of the site (not responsive design) and a fan-made app
  in the App Store.  I designed the official iOS and Android applications, currently
  available on Google Play and in the App Store.

### Reflection

These apps presented several new challenges for me. This was the first time I worked with developers in different timezones. Also, I took this project over from another designer and the project transferred owners. 

Having no design documentation or consistent project files meant I learned the value of clear communication and requirements gathering.

I fell in love with Material Design (which was fairly new at the time) designing the Android app.

**Roles in this project:** Visual and Interaction design, strategy, wireframes/layout, in collaboration with the shopping and mobile teams. 

_Note: the app has been updated since I left the company._
