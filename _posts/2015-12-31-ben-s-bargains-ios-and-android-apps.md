Ben's Bargains had a poor mobile experience. They had mobile version of the site (a limited template, not responsive design) and a fan-made app in the App Store.

I designed iOS and Android applications, currently available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.internetbrands.bensbargains&hl=en) and in the [App Store.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bens-bargains-shopping-for/id986201093?mt=8)

### REFLECTION

These apps presented several new challenges for me. This was the first time I worked with developers in different timezones. Also, I took this project over from another designer and the project transferred owners. The previous designer did not pass on her research and I remade all her Photoshop screens in Sketch.

Having no design documentation or standard design applications meant. I learned the value of clear communication and requirements gathering.

I fell in love with Material Design designing the Android app.

**Roles in this project:** Visual and Interaction design, strategy, wireframes/layout, in collaboration with the shopping and mobile teams. _Note: the app has been updated since I left the company._
