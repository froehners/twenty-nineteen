I'm passionate about user experience, interactive design, and solving problems. I love research, content strategy and designing for performance. My experience includes responsive web design, iBooks and mobile apps, YouTube partner content, content management systems, and branding. From micro-interactions to large content-driven systems, I love purposeful design.

I'm seeking a position where I can be a part of a collaborative team that values prototyping, iteration and solving problems with data driven design. I want to work for a company that believes in web accessibility and designing with empathy. Also, I really like dogs.
